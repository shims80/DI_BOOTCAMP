# my_fav_numbers.add(4)
# my_fav_numbers.add(8)
# my_fav_numbers.pop()
# friend_fav_numbers = {10, 5, 12, 22}
# our_fav_numbers = my_fav_numbers.union(friend_fav_numbers)
# print(our_fav_numbers)

# Exercise 2: Tuple

# Given a tuple which value is integers, is it possible to add more integers to the tuple?
# answer: no you can't add number to tuple as its immutable


# Exercise 3: Print A Range Of Numbers

# for i in range(1, 21):
#     print(i)


# Exercise 4: Floats

# Recap â€“ What is a float? What is the difference between an integer and a float?
# Floats represent numbers that are written with a decimal point
# and integers is a round number

# Can you think of another way to generate a sequence of floats?
# by using a for loop to generat a sequence of floats

# for i in range(1, 5):
#     print(i + 0.5)
#     print(i + 1)


# Exercise 5: Shopping List

# basket = ["Banana", "Apples", "Oranges", "Blueberries"]

#         print(i)

#             sum += 15
#         elif age > 3:
#             sum += 10
#     age = int(input("please type the age(type'0' to stop)"))
# print(f"ticket price is{sum}")
# age = int(input("please type the age(type '0' to stop):"))
# teens = []
