    <hr>
    <h4>Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and savannahs, but is absent in dense
        forests.<br>
        It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active at <br>
        night and at twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Prides vary in size
        and <br>
        composition from three to 20 adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability. Females cooperate when
        <br>
        hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and even giraffe<h4>
